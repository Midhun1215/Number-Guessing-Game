# Number-Guessing-Game
This is a game made using Python Which Helps in Basics
🚀 Number Guessing Game in Python 🎮
I recently built a fun Number Guessing Game using Python to sharpen my programming skills and practice concepts like functions, loops, conditionals, and user input handling.
🔑 Features of the Game:
--Difficulty Levels: Players can choose between three levels (easy, medium, hard), each with different ranges and number of chances.
--Random Number Generation: The program generates a random number within the chosen range.
--Interactive Feedback: After each guess, the game tells you if your number is too high or too low.
--Replay Option: At the end of each round, players can decide whether to continue or exit.

🧩 What I Practiced:
-Function design and modular coding.
-Using random.randint() for unpredictability.
-Handling user input and validating responses.
-Implementing recursion for replay functionality.

This project was a great way to combine logic building with user interaction design. It’s simple, but it demonstrates how Python can be used to create interactive console-based applications.
